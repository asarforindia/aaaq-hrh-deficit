Supplementary figures

National other norms line trend: 
5 (indices) x 4 (norms)= 20
National maps: 295
Line plots: 875

checked: change Y limits to - [min - 0.1, max + 0.1] for that dataframe

checked: dotted line everywhere, filled circles for data (1981- 2011) and hollow circles for projections (2021, 2031)

checked: 0 line width reduction

@917769050999 @919737709727 can you check if we have "doctor" or "doctors"? @17816584448 is going to use "doctor" for line plots.

checked: Y axis label general format for line plots: Deficit name (shorthand). E.g. Availability Deficit (AvD), Accessibility Deficit (AsD), Acceptability Deficit (ApD), Quality Deficit (QD)

Line plots: for India

checked: Map title general format - Deficit name (shorthand): Cadre Group (yyyy) E.g., Quality Deficit (QD): All Cadres (2011)
e.g., Availability Deficit (AvD) as per HLEG norms: Doctor (2001)

checked: map: change legend from intervals to numbers, e.g., instead of marking 0-0.25 in the middle of the bar, let's mark 0 at bar start and 0.25 at the end of bar.

legend for QD should go from 0 to +1. For others, -1 to +1.

rejected: aspect ratio for Indian map checking: height should greater that width.

@917769050999 need to check why some places too much data is missing for maps

@917350373527 was your sript which has state-level India maps with state names/abbreviations on the map in Python or R? Can you share the script with @17816584448

total 25 line plots and 300 map plots

for QD, AsD, and ApD Sex-mix

for AvD, ApD Cadre-mix

Clean norm names to use:

@917769050999 dataset link for Pushkar?

norm names to use in map titles: 1. HLEG, 2. Bhore Committee, 3. UHC Eff. Cov. 80, 4. UHC Eff. Cov. 90, 5. IPHS, 6. MDG target, 7. SDG target
